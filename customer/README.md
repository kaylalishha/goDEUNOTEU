# GO DEUNOTEU — Customer Dashboard

Customer-facing dashboard, kept separate from the admin dashboard (repo
root). Requirements: the "customer" tab of the PRD (FR-GO-L, FR-GO-PAY,
FR-GO-1/2/3). Styling follows the admin dashboard (Tailwind, slate + rose).

## Run

```bash
cd customer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/id.

## Pages

| Path | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `/id` | Landing page (FR-GO-L-001, L-002) |
| `/id?tab=order` | Order menu: Bayar Batch, Kalkulator Harga (L-003) |
| `/id?tab=tagihan` | Tagihan menu + "Posisi barang kamu" tracker (L-003, L-004) |
| `/id?tab=profile` | Login, profile, notifications (PAY-001, L-005) |
| `/id/order` | Bayar Batch (FR-GO-1-001 … 007) |
| `/id/ems-tax` | Tagihan EMS & Pajak (FR-GO-2-001 … 007) |
| `/id/calculator` | Kalkulator Harga (FR-GO-3-001 … 005) |

## Demo mode

LINE Login isn't set up yet, so the app runs on demo data: the same seed
data as the admin dashboard's demo mode (`src/shared/seed.ts`), saved in
this browser's localStorage.

- **Masuk** opens the LINE-only login (disabled for now) plus a
  "Masuk sebagai customer demo" picker.
- Submitting a proof follows the same rules as the backend's
  `submit_payment_proof`: own bill only, only while Belum Bayar.
- A pending bill shows "Simulasi admin (demo)" Konfirmasi / Tolak buttons,
  standing in for the admin's review.
- Profil → "Reset data demo" restores the seed data.

`src/shared/` holds copies of the admin's `types.ts`, `calc.ts`,
`format.ts` and `seed.ts`; keep them in sync with the admin app.
Moving to the real Supabase backend means replacing `src/store.ts`; the
pages only use its actions and selectors.

## Open decisions (`src/config.ts`)

- Payment instructions per method (account numbers, QRIS image).
- Tax payment methods (currently QRIS only, as in the admin's tax template).
- Proof upload size limit (5 MB placeholder).
- Whether tax can only be paid after the box's batch bills are Lunas
  (`TAX_REQUIRES_PAID_BATCH`, off).

Landing-page copy, numbers, links and photos are placeholders in
`src/content.ts`.

## Deploy (Vercel)

New Vercel project from this repo: **Root Directory = `customer`**,
framework Vite, production branch `customer-dashboard`. `vercel.json`
rewrites every path to `index.html` for client-side routing.
